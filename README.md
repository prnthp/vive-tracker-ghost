A blatant rip-off of a famous sports camera hand mount. Just add velcro straps!
You can find out how to put this together by looking at product videos and photos of the real mount.

## Vitamins Required
1. 1/4" - 20 TPI Screw: Any screw shorter than 0.35" should work
1. Velcro: Any hook-and-loop long enough to wrap around your hand twice should work

## Padding
You should add some foam/rubber padding underneath so it reduces conforms nicely with your hand or limb.

Enjoy!
